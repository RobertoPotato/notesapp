This has been abandoned for now. It does provide a simple navigation as well as network calls to a self-hosted Rest API built in Laravel. Only fetch has been created. So you get seeded data from the laravel backend here: https://github.com/RobertoPotato/notesServer.git 
The Laravel code will be uploaded later
